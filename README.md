### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thinking of so many things, working on a subset of those things, and planning ahead for the rest :)

I've been programming for almost a decade. It's so much fun to bring to life ideas that aren't possible in the phyiscal world, despite the debugging that comes along with it. I yearn for the unknown and I love to learn new things every day :)
